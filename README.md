Presented at JumboHack 2025 under the Down the Rabbit Hole track.

Our project is a two-fold solution designed to modernize academic advising.
On one side, we've developed an advising chatbot interface that both students
and advisors can use to get quick, informed responses to academic policy
questions. On the other, we've built an Outlook plugin that leverages our API
and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to automatically generate draft
responses from advisor emails, saving time and ensuring consistency in
communication.
